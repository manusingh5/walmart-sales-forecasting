# 📊 Walmart Sales Data Analysis & Forecasting using PySpark and Prophet

This project focuses on analyzing Walmart’s retail sales data and building a time series forecasting model using Facebook Prophet. The goal is to uncover sales patterns, seasonality, and trends that support data-driven business decisions like inventory planning and revenue forecasting.

Data was cleaned and preprocessed using **PySpark** in a **VMware-based Ubuntu environment** to handle larger datasets. The forecasting was done using **Facebook Prophet**, and final insights were shared through an **interactive Tableau dashboard**.
